# Starfighter Challenge

## Game Start
Player can select any ship to start the game. The first ship chosen becomes the player's ship throughout the game.

The player then selects the first enemy to attack.

## Gameplay
Player clicks on the attack button to attack the enemy character. The enemy character will automatically counter attack. Once the enemy's hit points are reduced to 0 or below the player must choose a new enemy, and the game loop continues. If the player can defeat all three enemies, they win!
